Why software development for me?

Simply put, my curiosity for coding was developed by preparing for grad school. I’ve taken a class here and there at the local community college, but I want to learn more.

So, it was my training in grad school that has prepared me for a curiosity of computers.  Why is that funny to me? Because my dad was a computer engineer.  I feel I should have learned to love computers from him, but instead I avoided it like the plague. I think I was trying to avoid STEM fields to fit into gender norms.   Now, I feel it’s my duty to go against the grain.              

Additionally, I think I’ve fallen in love.  I remember the hype about the first iPhone, the heavy breathlessness that would come with each new Apple event. I want to learn what the excitement is all about.

In a word, it’s fear of missing out.  It’s, hey-where-is-everyone-going, and that-looks-like-great-fun. It’s, hey-how-did-you-do-that and teach-me-your-mythical-magical-ways.

Maybe I don’t know why “software development”. Maybe that’s the wrong question.  Maybe the question should be, “why not?”
