Have you ever thought to yourself, I wonder how many sections do I have left? I wish I had some tangible list that I could cross off, so I can see how long of a journey is left.  Have no fear!  Some GENIUS made a GDoc:

Save a copy for yourself so you can edit.  I know, right!  Gone are the days of copying down on scrap paper the list of what you need to do. IT IS DONE FOR YOU. It's magical. It's mystical. Go get it.  The hills are alive with music.
